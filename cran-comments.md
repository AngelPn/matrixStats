# CRAN submission matrixStats 0.60.0

on 2021-07-26

I've verified that this submission does not cause issues for the 354 reverse package dependencies available on CRAN and Bioconductor. In addition, the package have been validated on R oldrel, R release, and R devel on Linux, macOS, and Windows. On Linux it's also been checked with Valgrind and ASan/UBSan as well as on R 2.15.0. On Solaris, it's been checked with R release.

Thank you
